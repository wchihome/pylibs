To harmonic analyze elevation time series (>2 days) at all nodes of hgrid.gr3, 
run ha.pl in this directory (3 inputs: hgrid.gr3, 1_elev.61 and tidal_const.dat).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harmonic analysis code from Arun can also be run separately:
./tidal_analysis <input time series> <tidal constituent file> <output file>
(tidal_analysis2 has larger max. dimension)

Format of tidal constituent file as in  tidal_const.dat:
# of constituents
constituent name (!!WARNING: no more than 3 alpha-numerics on this line; 
                  different freqs can use same name as these are not used in calculation !!)
angular freq. (unit consistent with time series, i.e., either in seconds or days).

time series file format: [time (in seconds or days etc.) value].

Output: amplitude and phase (in radians), defined as A*cos(\omega*t-\phi) (note the minus sign).

To compile: gcc tidal_analysis.c nrutil.c -lm
